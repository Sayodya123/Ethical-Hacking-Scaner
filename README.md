Ethical Hacking Learning Toolkit (Safe) — a small, instructor-friendly bundle that teaches basic reconnaissance techniques in a safe, controlled way. Created by Sayodya hasaranga, this toolkit is intentionally locked to localhost by default and requires explicit, conscious steps to enable any remote testing.

Key features:

Safe-by-default port scanner (tool/safe_scan.py) that scans 127.0.0.1 unless ALLOW_REMOTE=1 is set and you confirm permission.

Clear usage guide (GUIDE.md) with step-by-step startup, safety rules, and instructor notes.

Instructor-friendly structure: lab targets, example file metadata, and a permissive MIT license for teaching use.

One-line tagline:
A safe, minimal starter kit for learning ethical reconnaissance — built for classroom labs and responsible practice.
